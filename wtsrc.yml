# commands allows the user to attach a command line operation to any command - has 'pre' and 'post'
# if the 'pre' action fails - meaning the exit code is not 0 - the command will not be executed
# 
#commands:
#  cmd-name:
#    pre: "some command line action"
#    post: "some command line action"
# pre/post can be any command line value that is valid on your os - python scripts are shown as example only
#
# an example action - has only 'action'
#
#actions:
#  action-name:
#    action: "some command line action"

commands:

  # init cannot have a pre-action because the manifest repo containing this yml file happens during the init command
  init:
    post: "python scripts/initPostAction.py"

  # wtsrc checks for the exit status (must be 0) - otherwise the command is prevented from running if the pre-script exits with an error code
  show:
    pre: "python scripts/exampleFail.py"

# the actions section lets you define actions that can be called from any location in the tsrc workspace
